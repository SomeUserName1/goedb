# Access
This module shall provide access operators for the database. That is it shall provide the following operators:

- [ ] getNode (one)  
- [ ] getRelationship (one)  
- [ ] getRelationships (all)  
- [ ] get Node (all)  
- [ ] Expand  
- [ ] Filter  
- [ ] getNodesInRange (bulk)  
- [ ] getRelationshipsInRange (bulk)  

A reasonable extension would be to provide full text indices to properties and the like, i.e. all non-structural information
