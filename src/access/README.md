# Access
This module shall provide access operators for the database. That is it shall provide the following operators:

- [x] createNode
- [x] createRelationship
- [x] getNode (one)
- [x] getRelationship (one)
- [x] getRelationships (all)
- [x] get Node (all)
- [x] Expand
- [ ] Filter
- [ ] getNodesInRange (bulk)
- [ ] getRelationshipsInRange (bulk)

A reasonable extension would be to provide full text indices to properties and the like, i.e. all non-structural information
