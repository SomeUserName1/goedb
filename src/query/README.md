# Queries
Further is shall provides functions that use the other modules in order to generate access patterns, that is sequences of records and thus also disk blocks retreived from disk.  
The first query to be considered is breadth first search. Additionally Dijkstras algorithm and the A* algorithm are planned to be considered. Another class of possible queries to consider are random walks.

- [ ] BFS  
- [ ] A*
- [ ] Dijkstra
- [ ] Random Walk
- [ ] Spreading Activation
