TODO List:
- [x] Master Thesis Registration: Last handing in date is the 24th of May 2021  
- [ ] Write Neo4J Storage & Memory Design doc (WIP: Status - Record formats (properties, dynamic store) & Example BFS traversal  
- [ ] Implement N4J like Record structure in Rust
- [ ] Basic Buffer Mgr  
- [ ] Disk Space Mgr  
- [ ] Read Literature  
- [ ] Impl. 2 (static) examples from literature  
- [ ] Use History data access graph to update order (or similar)  

Problems List:  
- Keep up implicit indexing to preserve join-free traversals
