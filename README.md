# master
Master Project at the Database and Information Sytems Group, supervised by Dr. Theodoros Chondrogiannis and Prof. Michael Grossniklaus. Dynamic data locality optimizing storage scheme for graph databases.  

## Formalities
- [x] Master Thesis Registration: Last handing in date is the 25th of May 2021  


## Documentation
- [x] Write Neo4J Storage & Memory Design doc: Intro, Record Formats, BFS example   
- [ ] Write Neo4J Storage & Memory Design doc: Property Graph Model, Page Cache, IO parts, Dijkstra & A* example  
- Thesis  
	- [ ] Introduction
	- [ ] Background & Related Word
	- [ ] Our Method
	- [ ] Evaluation
	- [ ] Conclusion

## Implementation
- [ ] Record structures (WIP)  
- [ ] Cache  
- [ ] IO & Files  
- [ ] 2 methods from literature

## Cost model
- [ ] Setup theoretical cost model  

### Meeting
Thursday, 2'oclock
Prepare: Explain model, explain what we re trying to do s.t. input on the cost model can be provided by MG

## Locality improving ordering
- [ ] Read related literature  
- [ ] Pick 2 examples from literature  
- [ ] Use initial community detection + data access history graph to update order (or similar)
