Graphs are omnipresent in our world. 
Not only geographic maps and social networks, but also biological systems, like brains and the spreading of diseases are modeled using graphs.
Graph traversals are often used to examine such graphs, e.g. to find shortest paths between two places or to compute differential equation-based spreading processes.
Databases provide means to store large amounts of data reliable and scalable. 
As the bottleneck to data-intensive information processing in current computing systems is the amount of time spent to read and write data to secondary storage, this is commonly one of the most crucial aspects of scalability.
While relational databases have been optimized for decades, graph databases are a relatively new branch of research in this respect.
The former need to be optimized for selecting and joining tabular data, as the queries consist mostly of filtering data from different tables.
In graph databases, the most common query types are pattern-based and traversal-based queries. 
While the optimization of pattern-based queries has been explored to a certain degree, traversal-based queries recieved only little attention.
When travering a graph, disk accesses are governed by the structure of the graph.
To optimize the performance of traversal-based queries, the number of disk accesses needs to be minimized. 
This is achieved by leveraging what is called locality of reference.
One way to achieve this is to rearrange records such that, when these are accessed together, they are also stored together.
A survey of state-of-the-art graph record rearrangement strategies is presented, along with the proposition of an improvement to such methods on a particular record structure.
Finally, the methods are implemented and evaluated to measure the scalability of traversal-based algorithms in terms of block IOs.
