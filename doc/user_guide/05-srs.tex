\section{Software Requirement Specification}

\subsection{Introduction}
	\subsubsection{Purpose}
			The purpose of this Software Requirements Specification is to describe the features, constraints and demands of a research environment for the optimal layout of graph records on disk in detail. This document is intended for both the stakeholders and the developers of the system and will be proposed to the Dr. Theodoros Chondrogiannis, the supervising postdoctoral researcher.
	\subsubsection{Scope}
			This Software system shall implement a graph record layout research environment, that consists of a graph database along with tools, that rearranges the recrods of the database based on a predefined format, measure the number of disk accesses needed to service a certain query and that provide other layouts to compare against.

	\subsubsection{Overview}
		In the second chapter several conditions, assumptions and circumstances will be mentioned, that help charachterizing the software's special use case. In the thrid chapter the concrete requirements are listed.

		
\subsection{Overall description}
	\subsubsection{Product Perspective}
		The product shall rely on functions of unixoid OSes. 
		That is it uses the interfaces specified by the OpenGroup in the POSIX.1-2017 specification (also called IEEE Std 1003.1-2017)~\autocite{posix}.
		There are no relations to other software systems than the operating system during the runtime of the environment.

	\subsubsection{Product Functions}
	The product shall support different tasks in graph record layout research: 
		\begin{enumerate}
		 \item Import data into a graph database.
		 \item Query the database with a certain fixed function.
		 \item Rearange the record layout on disk with a layout given in a specific format.
		 \item Monitor the number of disk IOs.
		 \item Monitor the caching behaviour.
		 \item Provide interfaces for the implementation of new layout methods.
		 \item Provide a interfaces to ease the implementation of new queries.
		\end{enumerate}
		
        This shall be done using a graph database, that shall save related information to disk and load them into a cache on access, as well as support the common CRUD functionality. \\
        

	\subsubsection{User Characteristics}
		The potential users are the staff and student assistants of the DBIS group. Therefore standard user will have technical knowldege, and have visited at least a basic course on databases. Futher the users are able to program in C.
		There are three different types of users of this research environment: \\
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Researchers: Implements new layout method, benchmarks the result of the method against other layouts, visualizes the result of the benchmark. Should at least know the theory of how records are stored.
			
		 	\item Supervisors: Works on the administration and coordination of the project. Eventually hires other researchers and developers. Also a researcher.
		 	\item (Future) Developers: Uses the existing framework to extend the functionality, for example to implement additional queries of a different type, add new features like storing properties and similar things. Needs to know details of database architecture and implementation, more advanced C programming and some software engineering.
		\end{itemize}

		\end{center}

	\subsubsection{Constraints}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The database is expected to be run on a standard notebook and desktop machine, that is it needs to run without momory-related errors on a machine with 8 GiB RAM, no matter the data set size.
		\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
		The environment supports only POSIX-compliant OSes.
